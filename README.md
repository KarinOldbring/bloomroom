**Business Plan**

The fact that more and more trade is conducted online hardly comes as news to anyone. Especially since the pandemic more people wish to do their shopping from home to avoid crowded stores. Also, with more flexible working hours it's become more important to be able to do your shopping whenever it suits you, without having to adjust to opening hours. The pandemic was turbulent in many ways but for the flower/plant industry it has been blooming to say the least, and there's no sign of it slowing down! Lots of people staying home more than usual made them pay more attention to their home environment and wanting to invest more in their homes. Even though a lot of our everyday shopping has been online since many years the plant industry is falling behind. There are not that many online plant shops and that's why there certainly is room for a new actor! The strategy is to offer popular, high quality plants and full support for our costumers. Customers can call or email to get help and advice regarding already purchased products or if they wish to have recommendations regarding suitable plants for their homes. A userfriendly website, easy to navigate with secure and fast checkout will make our users loyal customers!

**Bugs
Error: Stripe Webhooks throwing throwing signature error
Solution: I had pasted the stripe public and secret key in my Gitpod variables, but not the webhook key. After consulting tutor support I was adviced to put them in my env.py file instead along with the wh-key. 

Error: Emails not being sent out
Solution: I was trying to send emails from a gmail which doesn't work on the development server, after I put DEVELOPMENT="True" in my env.py file the emails were sent out s expected. 

Error: When trying to view irder history an Error regarding unexpected keyword argument 'order_number' was thrown. 
Solution: It turned out I had the wrong URL path for the order_history instead of views.order_history I had views.profile. 

Error: When trying to checkout from the deployed app on Heroku, an error was thrown stating no API key was provided. 
Solution: I added the stripe keys to my Config Vars on Heroku which fixed the error.
