# **BloomRoom**

## **Introduction**

BloomRoom is a website where you can buy plants and have them delivered to your home! BloomRoom offers high quality plants and ship all over Europe. Users can create their own profiles so that their shipping and billing information is saved. As a customer you can also see your previous orders and update or delete your profile. 
Orders over 40$ are free and users can easily see when shopping when they have reached the free shipping limit. Products can be added to the cart and can be purchased using card payment. Order confirmation is sent to the email address provided. Users can also stay updated with all the latest and exclusive offers by following on Facebook page and by subscribing to the monthly newsletter.

**Business Plan**

The fact that more and more trade is conducted online hardly comes as news to anyone. Especially since the pandemic more people wish to do their shopping from home to avoid crowded stores. Also, with more flexible working hours it's become more important to be able to do your shopping whenever it suits you, without having to adjust to opening hours. The pandemic was turbulent in many ways but for the flower/plant industry it has been blooming to say the least, and there's no sign of it slowing down! Lots of people staying home more than usual made them pay more attention to their home environment and wanting to invest more in their homes. Even though a lot of our everyday shopping has been online since many years the plant industry is falling behind. There are not that many online plant shops and that's why there certainly is room for a new actor! 
The business model for this store would be a B2C (Business to Customer) model, as the business would be selling products directly from ourselves to the customer. The strategy is to offer popular, high quality plants and full support for our costumers. Customers can call or email to get help and advice regarding already purchased products or if they wish to have recommendations regarding suitable plants for their homes. A userfriendly website, easy to navigate with secure and fast checkout will make our users loyal customers! 

**Planning Stage**

The initial step in this project was to create a visual general idea of what the page should look like. Although it can be fun to get creative and come up with lots of ideas when it comes to designing a webpage as a user it is very convenient to feel "at home" even the first time you visit the site. With that said I wanted to create a unique looking site but I wanted the common features to be presented and placed in conventional spots on the page, for example the search bar should be on top of the page, always easy to find. 
Early on I also created wireframes for the site, to have a better idea of what I was aiming for. I also created all my user stories to make sure I applied all functionalities I wanted. 
One of many things I take away from this project is that you can't plan too much. Looking back I should have spent more time planning to be able to structure my work better and probably some time as well. With that said, overall I stuck to the inital plan regarding the project. 

**Project Goals**

My goal for this project was to create a userfriendly site for people who want to shop plants online. By offering a neat site, easy to navigate and make purchases. 

**User Stories**

*Agile methodology was used to create user stories.*
*GitHubâ€™s Kanban feature was used to track the progress of user stories.*

* As a site user I can search the site to easily find what I am looking for. 
* As a site user I can view a specific product so that I will get more detailed information. 
* As a site user I can view the products of the site so that I can see what the store offers. 
* As a site user I can categorize the products so that I can filter the results. 
* As a site user I can receive real time notifications to improve my user experience. 
* As a site user I can create an account so that I can shop from the store. 
* As a site user I can view my shopping bag so that I have complete overview of my purchase. 
* As a site user I can view, update and delete my account, so that I can manage my account. 
* As a site user I can receive emails regarding my purchases. 
* As a site user I can sign up for a newsletter so that I can take part of news and offers. 
* As a site owner I can log in to view the current products and their specifics on the site. 
* As a site owner  I can add new products to the site. 
* As a site owner I can update products on the site. 
* As a site owner I can delete products on the site. 
* As a site owner I can send confirmation and informational emails to my customers. 

**Design Goals**

Since the site features lots of images of plants and flowers I wanted a very subtle touch, and no sharp background colors that can disturb and take away focus from the product images. It was also  important to me that the site looks good and functions well on all devices, regardless of screen size. One of the main focuses of the site is naturally to sell products, and I believe that keeping the design clean and well structured is a good way to encourage shopping and making the customers wanting to come back. 

**Design Choices**

* Font

To stay aligned with my aim to present a clean and sophisticated site I chose an elegant font called Bellefair as the Heading font and the classic Source Sans Pro for all other text. 

![Google Font](/static/site_images/font.png)

* Color Scheme

Due to the very nature of the products sold on the site there was no need for lots of extra color and distraction. To keep the site visually appealing I chose to give the header and footer a light grey-blue background, and the logo and front page welcome text was given a very dark green color. Besides these colors I chose to keep the background color white and the text black. 

- Light grey/blue: #e9edf1
- Dark green: #253224
- White: #ffffff
- Black: #000000

* Logo BloomRoom

The BloomRoom logo was created using [Canva.com](https://www.canva.com/). Since the logo was too detailed to use as a Favicon I chose to design a special Favicon logo with the letters BR, short for the company name BloomRoom.

## **Wireframes**

Site moc-ups were designed using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). Since the site is built to be fully responsive one of the design goals was that the user should recognize the different pages and sections of the page no matter what size they were using. 

*Front Page*

![Front Page](/static/site_images/wf-index.png)

The front page is designed to give the user an instant understanding of the purpose of the page. From the home page you can easily access all product, account features, shopping bag etc. 

*About Page*

![About Page](/static/site_images/wf-about.png)

The about page is strictly for informational purpose. Here you can find information about BloomRoom and read about why to choose BloomRoom as your plant supplier. 

*Products*

![Products](/static/site_images/wf-products.png)

When clicking on Products, either from the dropdown menu in the navigation bar or from the Shop Here link on the middle of the home page, you reach the items that are being sold now. Here you get an overview of the products, an image, name and price.

**Bugs**
Error: Stripe Webhooks throwing throwing signature error
Solution: I had pasted the stripe public and secret key in my Gitpod variables, but not the webhook key. After consulting tutor support I was adviced to put them in my env.py file instead along with the wh-key. 

Error: Emails not being sent out
Solution: I was trying to send emails from a gmail which doesn't work on the development server, after I put DEVELOPMENT="True" in my env.py file the emails were sent out s expected. 

Error: When trying to view order history an Error regarding unexpected keyword argument 'order_number' was thrown. 
Solution: It turned out I had the wrong URL path for the order_history instead of views.order_history I had views.profile. 

Error: When trying to checkout from the deployed app on Heroku, an error was thrown stating no API key was provided. 
Solution: I added the stripe keys to my Config Vars on Heroku which fixed the error. 

Error: My biggest and most challenging bug was when I decided to make a switch from Cloudinary Storage to AWS. I encountered an etag error when using cloudinary and since not even the excellent help at Tutor support managed to combat that bug I decided to get rid of cloudinary and start over with aws. After making the setup the images and css was still not rendering correctly. Afte lots of troubleshooting and with amazing help from John Traas from CI he discovered two bugs in my setup. 
First solution - the Secret Access Key I got from AWS contained a forward slash (/) which causes an error that not even Amazon are able to tackle apperently. Second solution - the name I had chosen for my bucket was the same as my heroku app name which caused a name error. Hence I had to create a new bucket and do the setup etc once more. 
After this the site was rendering correctly apart from all the product images. This was because the media folder where the images are stored were not downloaded into the bucket automatically. After manually creating a media folder in the bucket, and uploading all of the images to it, the site was functioning as expected.
