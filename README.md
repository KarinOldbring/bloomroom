# **BloomRoom**

## **Introduction**

BloomRoom is a website where you can buy plants and have them delivered to your home! BloomRoom offers high quality plants and ship all over Europe. Users can create their own profiles so that their shipping and billing information is saved. As a customer you can also see your previous orders and update or delete your profile. 
Orders over 40$ have free delivery and users can easily see when they have reached the free shipping limit. Products can be added to the cart and can be purchased using card payment. Order confirmation is sent to the email address provided by the customer. Users can also stay updated with all the latest and exclusive offers by following BloomRooms Facebook page and by subscribing to the monthly newsletter.

### **Business Plan**

The fact that more and more trade is conducted online hardly comes as news to anyone. Especially since the pandemic more people wish to do their shopping from home to avoid crowded stores. Also, with more flexible working hours it's become more important to be able to do your shopping whenever it suits you, without having to adjust to opening hours. The pandemic was turbulent in many ways but for the flower/plant industry it has been blooming to say the least, and there's no sign of it slowing down! Lots of people staying home more than usual made them pay more attention to their home environment and wanting to invest more in their homes. Even though a lot of our everyday shopping has been online since many years the plant industry is falling behind. There are not that many online plant shops and that's why there certainly is room for a new actor! 
The business model for this store would be a B2C (Business to Customer) model, as the business would be selling products directly from ourselves to the customer. The strategy is to offer popular, high quality plants and full support for our costumers. Customers can call or email to get help and advice regarding already purchased products or if they wish to have recommendations regarding suitable plants for their homes. A userfriendly website, easy to navigate with secure and fast checkout will make our users loyal customers!

### **Planning Stage**

The initial step in this project was to create a visual general idea of what the page should look like. Although it can be fun to get creative and come up with lots of ideas when it comes to designing a webpage as a user it is very convenient to feel "at home" even the first time you visit the site. With that said I wanted to create a unique looking site but I wanted the common features to be presented and placed in conventional spots on the page, for example the search bar should be on top of the page, always easy to find. 
Early on I also created wireframes for the site, to have a better idea of what I was aiming for. I also created all my user stories to make sure I applied all functionalities I wanted. 
One of many things I take away from this project is that you can't plan too much. Looking back I should have spent more time planning to be able to structure my work better and probably some time as well. With that said, overall I stuck to the inital plan regarding the project.

### **Project Goals**

The app is designed as an e-commerce application that encourages users to make purchases. My goal for this project was to create a userfriendly site for people who want to shop plants online, by offering a neat site that is easy to navigate and make purchases.

### **Design Goals**

Since the site features lots of images of plants and flowers I wanted a very subtle touch, and no sharp background colors that can disturb and take away focus from the product images. It was also  important to me that the site looks good and functions well on all devices, regardless of screen size. One of the main focuses of the site is naturally to sell products, and I believe that keeping the design clean and well structured is a good way to encourage shopping and making the customers wanting to come back. 

### **Design Choices**

* Font

To stay aligned with my aim to present a clean and sophisticated site I chose an elegant font called Bellefair as the Heading font and the classic Source Sans Pro for all other text. 

![Google Font](/static/site_images/font.png)

* Color Scheme

Due to the very nature of the products sold on the site there was no need for lots of extra color and distraction. To keep the site visually appealing I chose to give the header and footer a light grey-blue background, and the logo and front page welcome text was given a very dark green color. Besides these colors I chose to keep the background color white and the text black. 

- Light grey/blue: #e9edf1
- Dark green: #253224
- White: #ffffff
- Black: #000000

![Color Scheme](/static/site_images/color.png)

* Logo BloomRoom

The BloomRoom logo was created using [Canva.com](https://www.canva.com/). Since the logo was too detailed to use as a Favicon I chose to design a special Favicon logo with the letters BR, short for the company name BloomRoom. 

![Logo](/static/site_images/logo.png)

![Favicon-logo](/static/site_images/favicon-logo.png) - Favicon Logo


* Images

All images on the site are taken from [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/). Pexels provides high quality and completely free stock photos licensed under the Pexels license.

## **Wireframes**

Site moc-ups were designed using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). Since the site is built to be fully responsive one of the design goals was that the user should recognize the different pages and sections of the page no matter what size they were using.

## **Features**

### **Existing Features**

### Header

#### Navigation menu

![Navbar Desktop](/static/site_images/navbar-1.png)     ![Navbar Mobile](/static/site_images/navbar-2.png)

The wide nav-bar is with links and icons is displayed on desktop screens. In the left corner is the BloomRoom logo, which when clicked takes you to the home page. Following the logo are several links to different parts of the site. First there is a link for "Home" whih has the same effect as clicking the logo but I still chose to add it for better UX experience and easier navigation. Next comes a link to the About section (more on that furhter down). After that there are links for the products. A dropdown link where you can either choose to view all products or select a specific category. The last link on the left hand side of the nav-bar is also a dropdown where users can manage their accounts. Depending on whether they are logged in or not, different options are displayed. The right hand side of the nav-bar contain the shopping bag to start with. A widely used icon symbolizing a shopping bag represents the bag under underneath it is the current shopping amount of the bag. Last but not least there is a search field. From here users can easily access items on the site by searching. The nav-bar toggles on smaller, mobile screens. The logo is still in the top left corner, and clicking it will direct you to the home page. The Home, About, Products and My Account links are toggled in to a burger icon, where you easily can access the different pages of the site. Beneath those are the shoppingbag icon and the searchfield. The nav-bar is always visible, no matter which device the user has. 

#### Footer

The footer contains links to the BloomRoom Facebook page and Instagram. On desktop screens the logo and en email address is also presented, clicking the logo takes you back to the home page. On the right hand side of the footer there is a sign up form for subscribing to the newsletter. The footer looks basically the same on mobile screens, apart from the mid section containing the logo and email address, that are hidden on smaller screens. 

#### Front Page

![Front Page](/static/site_images/frontpage.png)

The home page aims to be eye catching and explanatory at the same time. A sophisticated image showing popular plants greets the user. On the image there is a short description of the page and also a link to get directly to the products. 

#### About Page

On the About page the users can get more information about BloomRoom and why you should choose BloomRoom as your plant supplier. There is also contact information so that the user can easily can get in touch with BloomRoom. On smaller screens the image is hidden for better UX.

You can also sort the products by price, ascending and descending or by name.

When clicking on either a product image or its name you are directed to the product detail view. From here you get all information regarding the plant and you can also choose to add it in your shopping bag. There is also a button to redirect you back to the All products page. If the user is a superuser, there are also options to edit and/or delete the product directly from here. 

#### Manage Product

![Manage Product](/static/site_images/manage-product-page.png)

As a superuser you can easily navigate to manage specific products by clicking the Edit or Delete button. Clicking the Delete button removes the item immediately whilst clicking Edit takes you to the page displayed above. Here the superuser can update all details regarding the product. 

#### User Profile

![User Profile 1](/static/site_images/userprofile-page-1.png)     ![User Profile 2](/static/site_images/userprofile-page-2.png)

Choosing My Profile under the My Account link takes the user to their Profile. This action requires that the user is logged in, if not they will be asked to login or register. From here the user can update all information or delete it, and also get an overview of previous purchases. If the order number is clicked the user will be redirected to the specifications of that particular purchase.

#### Sign Up / In / Log Out

![Sign Up/In/Out](/static/site_images/signup-in-out-page.png)

From the nav-bar the user can easily access the different options Sign Up, Sign In or Log Out. Depending on the status of the user different options are presented, only logged in users can log out and vice versa. These pages are very straightforward and intentionally the layout is kept simple since the user is not supposed to linger here. From here users can also ask to reset their password in case they forgot it. 

#### Shopping bag

![Shopping Bag](/static/site_images/shoppingbag-page.png)

When users click on the shoppingbag icon in the nav-bar they are taken to the Shopping Bag view. If there are no items in the shopping bag a message stating that is displayed along with a button directing back to the products site. The Shopping Bag clearly displays the items currently in the bag, and an easy option to update quantity of those items or deleting them. You can also see the price for each item, the total price and whether or not you have reached the free shipping limit ($40). From the Shopping Bag view you can either go back to shopping or go further to the secure Checkout. 

#### Checkout Page

![Checkout Page 1](/static/site_images/checkout-1-page.png)      ![Checkout Page 2](/static/site_images/checkout-2-page.png)

When the user is done shopping they can go to the Checkout Page. From here they get to either fill in their shipping and billing information, or just complete the missing parts if they have information saved since before. Besides basic information like address the user can also add additional shipping information, for example in Sweden it is very common that you provide a code for the building front door. After filling out all information, the total amount that will be charged is clearly displayed and the user can then complete the checkout or go back to adjust the bag. 

#### Order Confirmation

![Order Confirmation](/static/site_images/order-confirmation-page.png)

After the user has completed the purchase, the user is directed to the Order Confirmation page. From here the user get a full overview of the purchase, shipping and billing information, as well as additional information if that was added. 

#### Newsletter Subscription

![Newsletter Subscription](/static/site_images/newsletter.png)

Any site user can easily sign up for Newsletter subscription to take part of news, offers etc. By entering their email they will receive newsletters. This service is handled by the [MailChimp Service](https://mailchimp.com).

### **General Features**

* Alert Message

![Alert Message](/static/site_images/alert.png)

Whenever the user interacts with the page, ie logs in, adds a product to the shopping bag updates their userprofile etc, an alert is displayed. This is a general feature that applies all over the page. 

[Back to content](#contents)

### **Future Features**

* A future version of BloomRoom could feature an option to comment and or rate products on the site. It could be a good way to involve the customers more. 
* Another feature that could quite easily be managed by the site owner is special offers or even gifts for customers on their birthdays. I included the option to add your date of birth in your Profile, which would enable the site owner to use that information. 
* As of now if a user wishes to delete their user profile, they are advised to send an email. This is not optimal and a future version would definitely include this option for the user. 
* Other products related to plants and flowers such as, flower pots, fertilizer etc could be added to the product list.

## **Marketing Techniques**

### **Target Audience**

The site owner imagines their typical customer to be a person of the age of somewhere between 20-50 years. The typical customer probably lives in an urban environment and does not have easy access to regular plant retailers. They are used to online shopping an appreciate the convenience of conducting their shopping online. This type of audience make Social Media platforms an extremely important place to advertise and be visible. 

### Social Media

#### Facebook

[BloomRoom Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/BloomRoom-110804875024055/?ref=pages_you_manage)
*Since Facebook regularly deletes mock-up pages I can not guarantee that the page will still be there, hence I have taken screen shots of the created page. Although I have written the content of the page in English, the rest of the site is in Swedish since it was created in connection to my personal account.*

![Facebook 1](/static/site_images/FB-1.png)
![Facebook 2](/static/site_images/FB-2.png)
![Facebook 3](/static/site_images/FB-3.png)

#### Instagram

Although this site does not yet have an Instagram account, creating one would be on the very top of my marketing strategies list. Lots of younger people today do not use Facebook in such extent and many customers turn to Instagram first. If the timeframe would have allowed it I would have created an Instagramm account for this site as well. 

### Newsletter

The BloomRoom site has a Newsletter Subscription form, which means that the site owner can send emails regarding special offers, upcoming campaigns, inspo and much more. By enabling the site users to sign up for the Newsletter, it is easy for the site owner to reach their customers with targeted advertising and hence encouraging potential customers to revisit the site again.

## **Testing**

Testing was done manually throughout the development process. The full rundown of the testing can be found in a separate [testing.md file](/testing.md).

## **Bugs**

* **Bug:** Stripe Webhooks throwing throwing signature error
    
    **Solution:** I had pasted the stripe public and secret key in my Gitpod variables, but not the webhook key. After consulting tutor support I was adviced to put them in my env.py file instead along with the wh-key. 

* **Bug:**: Emails not being sent out
    
    **Solution:** I was trying to send emails from a gmail which doesn't work on the development server, after I put DEVELOPMENT="True" in my env.py file the emails were sent out as expected. 

* **Bug:** When trying to view order history an Error regarding unexpected keyword argument 'order_number' was thrown. 
    
    **Solution:** It turned out I had the wrong URL path for the order_history instead of views.order_history I had views.profile. 

* **Bug:** When trying to checkout from the deployed app on Heroku, an error was thrown stating no API key was provided. 
    
    **Solution:** I added the stripe keys to my Config Vars on Heroku which fixed the error. 

* **Bug:** The webhook stripes started throwing errors again when making purchases. The payment itself went through but not the webhooks. 
    
    **Solution:** It turned out I had to remove the trailing slash from the checkout urls.py.

* **Bug:** When clicking all plants I wanted the different sub-categories to show up, but All Plants also showed up as a button. 

    **Solution:** Initially I had entered All plants as its own category, but I later realized that was abundant and hence removed that category entirely which took care of the issue. 

* **Bug:** My biggest and most challenging bug was when I decided to make a switch from Cloudinary Storage to AWS. I encountered an etag error when using cloudinary and since not even the excellent help at Tutor support managed to combat that bug I decided to get rid of cloudinary and start over with aws. After making the setup the images and css was still not rendering correctly. After lots of troubleshooting and with amazing help from John Traas from CI he discovered two bugs in my setup. 

    **First solution:** - The Secret Access Key I got from AWS contained a forward slash (/) which causes an error that not even Amazon are able to tackle apperently. 
    **Second solution:** - The name I had chosen for my bucket was the same as my heroku app name which caused a name error. Hence I had to create a new bucket and do the setup etc once more. 
    **Third solution:** After this the site was rendering correctly apart from all the product images. This was because the media folder where the images are stored were not downloaded into the bucket automatically. After manually creating a media folder in the bucket, and uploading all of the images to it, the site was functioning as expected.
